        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
          passwd.io does only one thing, but it tries to do it well.
          It allows you to store your confidential data (e.g. passwords,
          online banking credentials, etc.) online in a secure manner,
          but without the need to register, or to download an application.
        </p>
        <p>
          This allows you to have your data with you at all times and
          wherever you are, without any setup steps - as long as you have
          internet access, you will be able to securely access your data.
        </p>
  
        <h3>You own your data</h3>
        <p>
          The important thing is that your data is yours, and yours only.
          The information transmitted to the passwd.io servers is already
          encrypted - none of your confidential data is known to us, not
          your passphrase, not your content, not even your mail adress.
        </p>
        <p>
          This works because the passwd.io servers are just a "dumb" data
          store - encryption happens on the client, in your web browser.
          For this, passwd.io uses AES encryption and PBKDF2 hashing,
          two very secure crypto algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          You start by entering your mail adress and a passphrase. Both
          are hashed and sent to the server - this way, passwd.io is able
          to authenticate you, without the need to know what your mail adress
          and passphrase actually are. Only the hashes are received by the
          server.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cleartext passphrase is then used to encrypt your confidential
          data on the client - thus, only encrypted data is transferred.
        </p>
  
        <h3>We don't know any of you confidential data</h3>
        <p>
          Thus, the passwd.io server knows your hashed mail adress, your hashed
          passphrase, and your encrypted data. This way, we are completely unable
          to decrypt your data, because to do so, the unhashed passphrase is needed,
          which is never sent over the wire.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you access your data, again only the hashes are sent to the servers,
          and are used to find your encrypted data - which is then sent to your browser
          where it is decrypted locally by using your cleartext passphrase.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Account recovery is safe and simple</h3>
        <p>
          Because no registration is needed, it's possible for someone else to use your
          mail adress for storing data. However, this is not dangerous, because none of
          this data is ever transmitted or stored in the clear. However, it would stop
          you from using your own mail adress, because it's already taken - but there is
          a simple and secure solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          All you need to do is to use the account recovery function - you provide your
          mail adress - which in this single case actually needs to be sent to our servers
          in the clear. We then generate a one-time token for the account that was created
          using your address, and sent this token to your mail adress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because you are the actual, valid owner of this mail adress, only you are able
          to receive the token. You can then use it to completely delete the account and
          data stored for your mail address. You are then able to create a new account
          with your mail address.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are currently working on a fully automated recovery function. During the
          passwd.io beta, please just send an eMail to <a href="mailto:etc@passwd.io">etc@passwd.io</a>,
          and we will take care of everything.
        </p>
  
        <h3>So, how secure is it, really?</h3>
        <p>
          What could possibly go wrong? Here is a list:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Someone is eavesdropping your connection, reading the information you sent
                to and receive from the server.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>This isn't dangerous</b>, because only hashed and encrypted data is sent
                over the wire, making it extremely hard to break for the attacker. As long
                as you chose a strong passphrase, your data is secure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nevertheless, passwd.io runs over an encrypted TLS connection, which makes eavesdropping
                very difficult.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Someone breaks into the passwd.io servers and steals all data and code.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>This isn't dangerous</b>, because again, the attacker only gains access
                to encrypted and hashed data. He does not gain access to your mail address or
                passphrase, and, as long as you chose a strong passphrase, won't be able to
                decrypt your confidential data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nevertheless, we take a lot of precautions to make sure that our servers are
                protected against unauthorized access.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          Here is a list of stuff we do to make passwd.io secure:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>No external JavaScript</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                The passwd.io client code never loads any remote JavaScript files like e.g. Google Analytics,
                ad tags, or Facebook Like buttons, to prevent injection of harmful code into the page.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>
                  HTTPS only
                </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Even if you want to, you can't use passwd.io over a non-encrypted connection - usage of a
                TLS encrypted HTTPS connection is enforced.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>
                  Secure passphrases only
                </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                The weakest point in passwd.io security is the passphrase you choose.
                We therefore strongly recommend using strong passphrases, i.e., strings which are at least 
                24 characters long. While this might sound like impossible to memorize, it is
                in fact very simple - <a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">read more about that here</a>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>
                  Publicly available code
                </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                The client code of passwd.io, where hashing and encryption take place, is publicly available under
                a standardized open source license. Anyone, including you, can peer review the code for potential
                security weaknesses.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
